This file is more for myself for the progress of adding the planet packs to CKAN.  
Any help is welcome as I didn't test every planet pack with each other

---

**Conflicts:**
* Galactic Neighborhood conflicts with packs that aren't supported
* Kerbal Origins conflicts with Kerbol Plus Remade
* Real Solar System conflicts with any pack that changes the stock system (except when installed with GN)
* Ktolemy conflicts with any planet pack
* KerbalGalaxy2 conflicts with any planet pack
* Kerbal Binary conflicts with any planet pack
* ToySolarSystem conflicts with any planet pack (because it scales everything down)

    * The Sonne System
    * The Gliese-581 Star System
* Real Solar System is required by:
